        <h2>Whos' Isaac Newton</h2>
        <p>
          Sir Isaac Newton, was an English mathematicin, physicist, astronomer,
          theologian and author who is widely recognised as one of the most
          influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the
          scientific revolution
        
        
          His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical
          Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, laid the
          foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal
          contributions to optics, and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm
          Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus. Principia, Newton
          formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed
          the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the
          theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of
          gravity to prove Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides,
          the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other
          phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.
          He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial
          bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's
          inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by
          the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others,
          convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian
          mechanics over earlier systems. to find out more

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          Isaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar, in use in
          England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January
          1643[a]) "an hour or two after midnight". At Woolsthorpe Manor in
          Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire.
          His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before.
          Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough
          reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton
          was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband,
          the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his
          maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. Newton disliked his stepfather
          and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as
          revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of
          19: "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house
          over them." Newton's mother had three children from her second
          marriage. For more information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Click this page</a>

        <h2>Middle years</h2>
        <p>Newton's work has been said "to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied." His work on the subject usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers. The author of the manuscript De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins in August of that year as "[...] of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things." 
          Newton later became involved in a dispute with Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus (the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy). Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations. Occasionally it has been suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Leibniz's notation and "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.</p>
