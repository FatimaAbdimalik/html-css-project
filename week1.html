              Sir Isaac Newton, was an English mathematicin, physicist,
              astronomer, theologian and author who is widely recognised as one
              of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure

            <h2>Early life</h2>

            <p>
              Isaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar, in use in
              England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4
              January 1643[a]) "an hour or two after midnight". For more

            <h2>Middle years</h2>
            <p>
              Newton's work has been said "to distinctly advance every branch of
              mathematics then studied." His work on the subject usually
              referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of
              October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers.

            <h2>Optics</h2>
            <p>
              In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a
              prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when
              the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the
              prism refracts different colours by different angles.

            <h2>Later life</h2>
            <p>
              n the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing
              with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A
              manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the
              fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the
              original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished
              until 1785.
